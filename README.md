# Colorex.vim

Makes using Vim's colorscheme more fun

## Introduction

This plugin has several colorscheme-related functionalities like below:

- Save/Load your current colorscheme and airline theme (automatically when starting/quitting by default)
    - now no need to change colorscheme settings again and again in your `.vimrc`
- Toggle background color by executing `:ColorexToggleBackground` command
    - supports [ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-vim)'s dark/mirage/light
- Switch contrast by executing `:ColorexSwitchContrast`
    - supports [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) and [NeoSolarized](https://github.com/overcache/NeoSolarized)

## Installation

I recommend [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as Vim plugin manager.

```vim
Plug 'iwataka/colorex.vim'
```
