# Colorex.vim

## Introduction

Colorscheme is an important element for Vim editing. Once I had some
colorscheme-related configurations in my .vimrc but decided to create this
separate plugin called `colorex`.

This plugin has several functionalities like below:
- Save/Load your current colorscheme (automatically by default)
- Toggle background color by executing `:ColorexToggleBackground` command
- Switch contrast by executing `:ColorexSwitchContrast` (supporting only gruvbox and solarized)

## Installation

If you don't have your favorite plug-in manager, I strongly recommend
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

```vim
Plug 'iwataka/colorex.vim'
```

## Usage

Please check `:help colorex` for more details
